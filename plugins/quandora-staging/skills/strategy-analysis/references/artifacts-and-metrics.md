# Strategy Artifacts And Metric Semantics

Apply each artifact's declared schema and window. Missing or null values remain unavailable.

## Primary Evidence

- `sb_get_run` provides canonical composition and effective parameters.
- `sb_get_artifact` with `summary` and `performance` provides headline result metrics.
- Equity and drawdown curves show path dependence, concentration, and recovery.
- Turnover and exposure curves show implementation intensity and neutrality through time.
- Attribution and signal-return curves can support mechanism claims only when actually included.
- Orders and trades are execution evidence, not substitutes for the canonical run snapshot.

## Return And Drawdown

- Compare return, Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown, and fees over the same declared period.
- Treat a signed negative drawdown as a loss from peak; name the sign convention when reporting it.
- A high return with concentrated time contribution or slow drawdown recovery is less robust than
  an evenly distributed path with the same headline return.
- Funding cash flow, when present, is signed received-minus-paid and remains separate from total
  fees. Do not apply it to equity a second time.

## Strategy Turnover

- Strategy daily turnover is single-sided: `sum(abs(delta weight)) / 2`.
- Factor cross-sectional turnover uses a different convention without `/2`. Name the convention
  before comparing the two.
- Interpret turnover with rebalance bars, modeled fees, signal persistence, and realized breadth.

## Composition

- `composition.mode: ids` means equal weighting across selected factor identities.
- `composition.mode: weights` means explicit positive factor weights from the canonical snapshot.
- The factor list alone does not prove each factor's marginal contribution.
- Do not infer correlations, ablations, or standalone factor quality from Strategy-level returns.

## Scope Labels

- `IS` means in-sample.
- `OOS` means a separately declared out-of-sample scope.
- `ALL` combines available scopes and includes IS; it is not pure OOS.
- Always report the exact artifact label and window rather than upgrading the scope in prose.
