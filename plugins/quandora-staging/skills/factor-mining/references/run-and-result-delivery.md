# Factor Run and Result Delivery

Load this reference after a Factor backtest is submitted, when an existing non-terminal run must be
continued, or when the user requests the Result Bundle.

## Mutation Recovery

`retryable` describes availability; `recovery_action` controls mutation behavior:

- `repair_and_revalidate`: repair allowlisted diagnostics and validate the complete source again.
- `create_same_kind_session_after_input_change`: create a new public/custom session of the same
  kind with a new invocation identity.
- `retry_same_pending_request`: replay at most once with the exact pending handle, bound request,
  persisted idempotency identity, and unchanged validated source.
- `resume_known_run`: use only `continue_factor_backtest` on the exact returned run.
- `stop_and_report_trace`: stop and report only the safe trace.
- `repair_then_create_same_kind_session`: repair, revalidate, then create the same kind of session
  before one ordinary upload.

Never infer mutation authority from a generic retry flag. Never upload again when a known run says
resume.

## Bounded Observation

Use `continue_factor_backtest` only for an exact known non-terminal run and at most four times in one
request. It re-drives backend work; it is not a status read. If still running, stop, report that the
run can be continued later, and do not request Result Bundle metadata.

## Result Bundle

Only a terminal run may enter delivery. Call `create_factor_result_bundle_download` with the exact
terminal `job_id`. Treat the returned immutable metadata and manifest as authoritative; readable
`available` and persisted readable `partial` snapshots can be downloaded.

If the first response is `pending` with `bundle_materializing`, wait at most ten seconds and make
one fresh metadata call without a snapshot revision. If a readable partial reports pending items,
one separate ten-second freshness refresh is allowed. Neither bound is a polling loop, and neither
resubmits or continues the completed run.

Prefer the returned short-lived URL: consume it immediately and unchanged into a task-created
`.partial`, checking byte count and SHA-256 while streaming. One fresh-ticket retry is allowed only
after an actual transient HTTP failure. If URL transfer remains unavailable, call
`read_factor_result_bundle_chunk` with the same job and revision:

- start at offset 0 and request at most 262144 raw bytes;
- append decoded bytes before interpreting `terminal`;
- require exact offset progression and at most `ceil(size_bytes / 262144)` calls;
- bind every response to the same selector, revision, filename, content type, size, and hash;
- a terminal response may contain the final non-empty bytes and must have `next_offset: null`.

Verify exact size/hash, ZIP magic/openability, and safe relative entries before atomic rename. On
failure, discard only the task-created unverified partial.

The canonical local destination is
`Quandora staging result/factor/<factor_slug>.zip`. Derive the slug only from the exact accepted
matching `FACTOR_TYPE` literals; never silently fall back to a generic `factor` slug. Use a
user-requested safe destination when supplied. Never overwrite unrelated bytes, extract/rebuild the
archive, synthesize entries, or create a second completed `run_summary.json`.

If the selected snapshot is partial, report its exact omissions and pending reasons. Include the
public job handle only when needed for continuation, recovery, export, or handoff. Never include
revisions, tickets, URLs, or base64 in the final summary.
