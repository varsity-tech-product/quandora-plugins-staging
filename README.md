# Quandora Plugins

Quandora Plugins is the public marketplace for Quandora agent integrations.
Version 0.4.4 ships one all-in-one plugin package:

```text
quandora@quandora
```

Factor Mining is the first bundled skill. It uses Quandora Remote MCP over
HTTP/OAuth for public task listing, custom factor sessions, inline
`plugin_source` submission, backtesting, artifact retrieval, and result
summaries.

The Remote MCP server is named:

```text
quandora-mcp
```

The current Quandora Remote MCP endpoint is:

```text
https://mcp.quandora.ai/factor-mining
```
