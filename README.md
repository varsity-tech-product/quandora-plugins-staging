# Factor Mining Agent Plugins

Product repository for local agent plugins that connect agent coding tools to
Factor Mining.

The included adapters let an agent create or locate `plugin.py`, validate
metadata without executing generated code, upload the plugin to Factor Mining,
submit a backtest, wait for results, retrieve the default factor card, and
summarize the outcome for the user.

## Adapter Status

- Codex: supported with a native Codex plugin manifest and skill.
- Claude Code: adapter-ready with a native Claude Code plugin manifest, skill,
  and packaged helper scripts.
- OpenClaw: adapter-ready with a native OpenClaw plugin manifest, skill, and
  packaged helper scripts. Official OpenClaw tool validation is not included in
  this repository.

## Repository Layout

- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` publishes the local plugin entry.
- `codex/plugins/factor-mining/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` is the Codex plugin manifest.
- `codex/plugins/factor-mining/scripts/` contains the setup and workflow helpers.
- `codex/plugins/factor-mining/skills/factor-mining/SKILL.md` defines Codex behavior.
- `codex/plugins/factor-mining/tests/` covers local state, security, and API request construction.
- `codex/plugins/factor-mining/tests/acceptance/` runs the mock backend acceptance flow.
- `claude-code/` contains the Claude Code plugin package.
- `openclaw/` contains the OpenClaw plugin package.

## User Flow

1. Install the Factor Mining adapter for the target agent.
2. Provide a Factor Mining Agent API Key through secure setup.
3. Let the agent create or reuse a task-backed session.
4. Let the agent create or locate `plugin.py`.
5. Let the agent run the waitable upload and backtest command.
6. Review the summarized result, including job status, failures, metrics, and artifacts.

Setup always verifies `/health` and `/agent/status`. Setup succeeds only when
the API is healthy and `/agent/status` accepts the delegated Factor Mining Agent
API Key. The current success response is `status: ok` and `agent_key: valid`;
a `403` response means the key is not an external-agent credential.

## Codex CLI Install

For Codex, the shortest product flow is to install the marketplace, install the
plugin, and start a Codex session with the Factor Mining workflow prompt. The
Agent API Key is not passed to the installer. Codex runs the plugin setup helper,
which asks for the key through a secure prompt.

From a clone of this repository:

```bash
./install-codex.sh
```

For direct distribution from GitHub:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/varsity-tech-product/factor-mining-agent-plugins/main/install-codex.sh | bash
```

Set `FACTOR_MINING_PLUGIN_REF` to pin a release or branch:

```bash
FACTOR_MINING_PLUGIN_REF=v0.1.0 ./install-codex.sh
```

Set `FACTOR_MINING_START_CODEX=0` to install only, without starting a Codex
session.

### Manual Codex CLI Commands

These are the three commands run by the installer:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add varsity-tech-product/factor-mining-agent-plugins --ref main
codex plugin add factor-mining@factor-mining-marketplace
codex "Use the Factor Mining plugin. Set up Factor Mining with my Agent API Key through the secure setup prompt. Do not ask me to paste the key into chat. Then choose an open task, write a valid plugin.py, upload it, wait for the backtest, fetch the default factor card if available, and summarize the result."
```

For local product validation, replace the first command with the repository path:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/factor-mining-agent-plugins
```

## Validation

Run these checks from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s codex/plugins/factor-mining/tests -v
python3 -m compileall -q codex/plugins/factor-mining/scripts codex/plugins/factor-mining/tests
python3 -m compileall -q claude-code/scripts openclaw/scripts
python3 -m json.tool .agents/plugins/marketplace.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool codex/plugins/factor-mining/.codex-plugin/plugin.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool openclaw/openclaw.plugin.json >/dev/null
bash -n install-codex.sh
python3 codex/plugins/factor-mining/tests/acceptance/run_mock_acceptance.py
```

For the official Codex plugin validator, create a temporary virtual environment,
install `requirements-dev.txt`, and run the validator from your Codex
installation against `codex/plugins/factor-mining`.
