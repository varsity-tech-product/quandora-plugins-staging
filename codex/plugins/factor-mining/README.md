# Factor Mining Codex Plugin

Codex plugin for the Factor Mining external-agent workflow.

Codex uses this plugin to create or locate `plugin.py`, inspect metadata without
executing generated code, upload the plugin to Factor Mining, submit a backtest,
wait for terminal workflow and job state, retrieve the default factor card, and
summarize the result.

The default Factor Mining entry point asks the user to choose `open task` or
`my own idea` before a session is created.

## Codex CLI Install

Install from the repository root:

```bash
./install-codex.sh
```

The installer configures the Factor Mining marketplace, installs the Codex
plugin, asks for the Factor Mining Agent API Key in the terminal with hidden
input, validates setup, and starts a Codex session with the Factor Mining
workflow prompt. The key is not pasted into chat, not passed as a command
argument, and not written to shell history.

Manual install uses three Codex CLI commands:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add varsity-tech-product/factor-mining-agent-plugins --ref main
codex plugin add factor-mining@factor-mining-marketplace
PLUGIN_ROOT="$(codex plugin list --marketplace factor-mining-marketplace | awk '$1 == "factor-mining@factor-mining-marketplace" { print $NF; exit }')" && python3 "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/factor_setup.py" && codex "Use the Factor Mining plugin. Verify Factor Mining status. Ask me to choose either open task or my own idea before creating a session. Then write a valid plugin.py locally, upload it, wait for the backtest, fetch the default factor card if available, and summarize the result."
```

For Codex Desktop, run from the repository root:

```bash
./install-codex-desktop.sh
```

## Setup

Run setup from the plugin directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_setup.py
```

The setup command prompts for the Factor Mining Agent API Key without echoing
the value. Do not paste the key into chat.

Inside an active Codex CLI or Codex Desktop session, switch to a different
Agent API Key with the local browser setup page:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_setup.py --browser
```

Paste the key into the browser page, not into chat. The next Factor Mining
helper command reads the updated local config.

Automation can provide the key without a prompt:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_setup.py --api-key-stdin
```

Setup uses this Factor Mining API URL by default:

```text
https://d25q1jf66e8y4g.cloudfront.net
```

Use `--base-url` only for a staging or private Factor Mining API environment.
The configured environment must expose `/agent/status`; the plugin deliberately
rejects credentials that the endpoint does not accept as delegated Agent API
Keys.

Local configuration is stored at:

```text
~/.factor-mining-agent/config.json
```

Run state is stored at:

```text
~/.factor-mining-agent/runs/<client_run_id>.json
```

## Agent Workflow

Codex normally runs these helpers for the user:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_status.py
python3 scripts/factor_api.py tasks --limit 20 --status open
python3 scripts/factor_api.py create-session --task-id <task_id> --client-run-id <client_run_id>
python3 scripts/factor_api.py create-session --idea "<research idea>" --task-payload-file task_payload.json --client-run-id <client_run_id>
python3 scripts/factor_api.py metadata --plugin-path plugin.py
python3 scripts/factor_upload_backtest.py --session-id <session_id> --plugin-path plugin.py --client-run-id <client_run_id> --position-mode both --fwd-period 7 --wait
python3 scripts/factor_api.py resume --client-run-id <client_run_id> --wait
```

Worker sessions can use a published `task_id`. Custom sessions must include a
direct `task_payload` so external-agent uploads are task-backed. The payload must
include `task_id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, non-empty `allowed_data`,
and `fwd_period`. Include any useful hints, research fields, or mechanism notes
that help Codex generate the factor.

The upload helper default is `fwd_period=7`. The wait command returns compact
JSON containing `ok`, `status`, `terminal_status`, `client_run_id`,
`session_id`, `plugin_id`, `job_ids`, workflow status, terminal jobs, artifact
availability, and summary fields suitable for Codex to report.

## Security

- Use only a Factor Mining delegated Agent API Key.
- Do not use frontend user keys, OpenAI API keys, Codex auth files, or BYOK
  credentials with this plugin.
- Setup always calls `/health` and `/agent/status`.
- Setup succeeds only when `/health` is healthy and `/agent/status` accepts the
  delegated Agent API Key. The current success response is `status: ok` and
  `agent_key: valid`.
- A `403` response from `/agent/status` means the key is not an external-agent
  credential.
- API keys are redacted from output and errors.
- Upload requests omit optional `submitter_label` and `agent_id` fields so the
  backend applies external-agent provenance from the API key.
- `plugin.py` metadata is parsed with `ast` and `ast.literal_eval`; generated
  code is never imported or executed by the helper scripts.
- Generated `plugin.py` source is uploaded as multipart request content but is
  not written to logs or run summaries.
- Artifact `404` and `410` responses are reported as unavailable. Authentication,
  authorization, network, malformed response, and server errors fail clearly.

## Quality Checks

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s codex/plugins/factor-mining/tests -v
python3 -m compileall -q codex/plugins/factor-mining/scripts codex/plugins/factor-mining/tests
python3 -m compileall -q claude-code/scripts openclaw/scripts
python3 -m json.tool .agents/plugins/marketplace.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool codex/plugins/factor-mining/.codex-plugin/plugin.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool openclaw/openclaw.plugin.json >/dev/null
bash -n install-codex.sh
bash -n install-codex-desktop.sh
python3 codex/plugins/factor-mining/tests/acceptance/run_mock_acceptance.py
```

When a Codex plugin validator is available in the environment, run it against
`codex/plugins/factor-mining`.
