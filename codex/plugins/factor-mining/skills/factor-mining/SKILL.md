# Factor Mining Local Agent

Use this skill for the Factor Mining Codex plugin product flow. Codex writes or
locates one local `plugin.py`. Factor Mining validates, stores, backtests, and
returns workflow, job, artifact, and factor result data through orchestrator
APIs.

Codex runs the helper commands from the plugin directory and summarizes the
result for the user. The user does not need to run the command sequence manually.

## Setup And Status

Setup uses the production Factor Mining API URL by default:

```text
https://d25q1jf66e8y4g.cloudfront.net
```

If setup is missing, run setup from the plugin directory. Never ask the user to
paste the Factor Mining Agent API Key into chat.

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_setup.py
```

When Codex is already running and the user wants to add or switch Agent API
Keys, use the local browser setup page:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_setup.py --browser
```

The browser setup page opens on `127.0.0.1`, accepts the Agent API Key in a
password field, validates it with Factor Mining, saves the local config, and
then exits. The key must never be pasted into chat.

The plain setup script collects the Agent API Key through a hidden terminal
prompt. For non-interactive automation, it can read the key from non-echo stdin:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_setup.py --api-key-stdin
```

Use `--base-url` only when the user explicitly provides a staging or private
Factor Mining API environment:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_setup.py --base-url <staging-or-private-api-url>
```

Setup and status must call `/agent/status`. Continue only when `/health` is
healthy and `/agent/status` accepts the delegated Agent API Key. The current
success response is `status: ok` and `agent_key: valid`. If `/agent/status`
returns `403`, tell the user the key is not an external-agent credential.

Configuration is stored outside project repositories at:

```text
~/.factor-mining-agent/config.json
```

Run state is stored at:

```text
~/.factor-mining-agent/runs/<client_run_id>.json
```

## Hard Security Rules

- Use only a delegated Factor Mining Agent API Key accepted by `/agent/status`.
- Never ask for OpenAI API keys, Codex auth files, BYOK secrets, or frontend
  user credentials.
- Never print, persist in logs, or summarize full API keys.
- Do not call QuantAI service endpoints directly.
- Do not call hosted generation endpoints such as `/brainstorm`, `/generate`,
  or `/regenerate`; local-agent mode generates code inside Codex.
- Do not call `/models`, `/prompts/preview`, `/llm-credentials/*`,
  `/codex-profiles/*`, or `/me/external-agent-key`.
- Do not create, update, or patch tasks; delegated external-agent keys are
  read-only for task publication surfaces.
- Do not import, exec, eval, or otherwise execute generated `plugin.py`.
- Use `python3 scripts/factor_api.py metadata` or the same `ast` plus
  `ast.literal_eval` approach for static metadata extraction.
- Do not print generated `plugin.py` source in summaries.
- Use only user-visible orchestrator IDs in reports: `session_id`, `plugin_id`,
  `job_id`, `factor_id`, and `strategy_run_id`.
- Treat downstream IDs, presigned URLs, and service metadata as internal fields.

## Acceptance Flow

1. Confirm setup.
   - If config is missing or invalid, run setup.
   - If Codex is already running and the user needs to use a different key, run
     `python3 scripts/factor_setup.py --browser`.
   - If setup rejects the key, tell the user to provide a Factor Mining Agent
     API Key, not a frontend user key.

2. Ask the user to choose the research entry point before creating a session:
   `open task` or `my own idea`.
   - For `open task`, read open tasks, show concise choices, and ask the user
     to pick one unless they explicitly ask Codex to choose.
   - For `my own idea`, ask for the user's custom factor idea, then create a
     direct `task_payload` before session creation.

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_api.py tasks --limit 20 --status open
```

3. Create or reuse a task-backed session.

For worker mode, a published `task_id` is enough:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_api.py create-session --task-id <task_id> --client-run-id <client_run_id>
```

For free mode, create a direct `task_payload` before upload. It must include at
minimum:

- `task_id`
- `title`
- `category`
- `description`
- `allowed_data`
- `fwd_period`

`allowed_data` must include every input column the generated `plugin.py` needs,
such as `close`, `volume`, `funding_rate_close`, or `open_interest_close`.
Include useful hints, economic mechanisms, regime considerations, risk sources,
and target behavior when they are available.

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_api.py create-session --idea "<research idea>" --task-payload-file task_payload.json --client-run-id <client_run_id>
```

4. Request dedup context when you have a draft description and formula. Use the
   returned similar factors and duplicate-risk guidance to avoid
   near-duplicates.

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_api.py dedup-context --session-id <session_id> --description "<draft description>" --formula "<draft formula>"
```

5. Write or locate one `plugin.py`.
   - Return a `pd.DataFrame` aligned with `close`.
   - Use only current and historical data.
   - Keep Python `build_signal` and `FACTOR_SECTIONS` C# compute logic aligned.
   - Keep the data columns within the session `allowed_data` contract.

6. Inspect metadata statically before upload.

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_api.py metadata --plugin-path plugin.py
```

7. Run one waitable upload and backtest command. Use `fwd_period=7` when neither
   the task nor user specifies a horizon.

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_upload_backtest.py --session-id <session_id> --plugin-path plugin.py --client-run-id <client_run_id> --position-mode both --fwd-period 7 --wait
```

The upload helper intentionally omits optional `submitter_label` and `agent_id`
fields. Factor Mining applies its external-agent provenance defaults from the
delegated API key.

8. Summarize the compact JSON returned by the wait command. Always inspect
   `ok`, `status`, `terminal_status`, and `failures`. If `ok` is false or
   `failures` is present, report the failed or cancelled job clearly instead of
   presenting the run as successful.

## plugin.py Contract

Use this minimum shape when the user has not supplied an existing plugin. The
metadata values must be static top-level literals so the helper can parse them
without executing source code.

```python
from typing import Any, Dict

import pandas as pd

FACTOR_TYPE = "snake_case_unique_factor_type"
FACTOR_NAME = "human_readable_factor_name"
FACTOR_DEFAULT_PARAMS = {"window": 7}

FACTOR_SECTIONS = {
    "__FACTOR_DESCRIPTION__": "Trailing close-to-close momentum.",
    "__FACTOR_FORMULA__": "close / close[window bars ago] - 1",
    "__FACTOR_TYPE__": FACTOR_TYPE,
    "__FACTOR_PARAM_FIELDS__": "        private int _window;\n",
    "__FACTOR_INIT__": '            _window = GetIntParameter("window", 7);\n',
    "__FACTOR_LOG__": '            Log($"[INIT] window={_window}");\n',
    "__PRICE_WINDOW_EXPR__": "_window + 1",
    "__EXTRA_BUF_FIELDS__": "",
    "__EXTRA_BUF_ENQUEUE__": "",
    "__EXTRA_BUF_DEQUEUE__": "",
    "__EXTRA_BUF_TOARRAY__": "",
    "__FACTOR_COMPUTE_BODY__": """
            var n = prices.Length;
            if (n < _window + 1) return false;
            var past = prices[n - _window - 1];
            if (past == 0) return false;
            rawSignal = prices[n - 1] / past - 1.0;
            return true;
""",
}


def build_signal(close: pd.DataFrame, params: Dict[str, Any], **data: Any) -> pd.DataFrame:
    window = int(params.get("window", FACTOR_DEFAULT_PARAMS["window"]))
    signal = close.pct_change(window)
    return signal.reindex_like(close)
```

Factor Mining backend validation is the authority for runtime contract details.
If upload returns validation `errors` or `warnings`, read them, edit
`plugin.py`, and retry upload. Do not call platform regenerate.

## Backtest And Artifacts

For asynchronous POST endpoints, HTTP `202 Accepted` is expected success.
Treat either `200` or `202` as success for session creation, plugin upload, and
backtest submission.

Short-term deployments may return one job with `position_mode: "cs_only"`.
Do not expect separate TS and CS jobs unless the configured Factor Mining API
environment explicitly returns them.

The wait command fetches `default_factor_card.json` when available. It reports
artifact `404` and `410` as unavailable and continues with the core job result.
Authentication, authorization, network, malformed response, and server errors
must fail clearly with redacted stderr.

Use resume with waiting after an interrupted Codex session:

```bash
python3 scripts/factor_api.py resume --client-run-id <client_run_id> --wait
```

## Result Report

Always include fields that are available in the factor card or job response:

- `ok`
- `status`
- `terminal_status`
- `failures`
- `position_mode`
- `cs_success` and `cs_fail_reasons` when present
- `ts_success` and `ts_fail_reasons` only when present
- `composite_sharpe`, `composite_annual_ret`, and `composite_max_dd`
- `cs_branch.simulation.{sharpe,return,max_drawdown,turnover,fitness}`
- `ts_branch.simulation.{sharpe,return,max_drawdown,turnover,fitness}` only
  when TS results are present
- `icir`, `win_rate`, and `rank_icir`
- `requested_fwd_period`, `actual_fwd_period`, and `horizon_warning`

## Advanced Surfaces

Retest, factor library, promotion, and strategy composition are outside the
normal helper flow. If the user explicitly asks for those operations, inspect
the current Factor Mining API docs, keep all calls user-scoped, and respect
feature gates returned by the API.
